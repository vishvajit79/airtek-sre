Certainly! Here's an example README file that provides instructions on how to deploy the stack using Pulumi:

# ASP.NET Web and API Deployment with Pulumi

This project demonstrates how to deploy an ASP.NET web application and an API in AWS using Pulumi. The web application and API are deployed as Docker containers in an Amazon ECS cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Pulumi CLI (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- .NET SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Deployment Steps

Follow the steps below to deploy the ASP.NET web and API applications using Pulumi:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vishvajit79/airtek-sre.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd airtek-sre
   ```

3. Initialize a new Pulumi stack:

   ```bash
   pulumi stack init <your-stack-name>
   ```

4. Configure the AWS region and credentials for the Pulumi stack:

   ```bash
   pulumi config set aws:region <aws-region>
   pulumi config set aws:accessKey <your-aws-access-key>
   pulumi config set aws:secretKey <your-aws-secret-key>
   ```

   Replace `<aws-region>` with your desired AWS region (e.g., us-west-2) and `<your-aws-access-key>` and `<your-aws-secret-key>` with your AWS access key and secret key.

5. Build the Docker images for the web UI and API:

   ```bash
   cd infra-web
   docker build -t my-web-ui-image .
   cd ../infra-api
   docker build -t my-api-image .
   ```

6. Return to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

7. Deploy the stack using Pulumi:

   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

   Pulumi will show you a preview of the resources to be created. Type `yes` to confirm the deployment.

8. Wait for the deployment to complete. Pulumi will display the stack outputs once the deployment is finished, including the URLs for the web UI and API Gateway.

9. Access the web application:

   Open a web browser and visit the URL shown in the `web_ui_url` output. You should see the deployed ASP.NET web application.

10. Access the API:

    Use the API Gateway URL provided in the `api_gateway_url` output to interact with the API. The API is only accessible from the web UI.

11. Cleanup:

    When you're done with the deployment, you can clean up the resources created by Pulumi by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pulumi destroy
    ```

    Type `yes` to confirm the destruction of the stack resources.

That's it! You have successfully deployed the ASP.NET web application and API using Pulumi.
